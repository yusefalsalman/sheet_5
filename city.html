                <h1>Amman City</h1>
                <p>
                    Amman is the capital city of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, and one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. Historically known as "Rabbath Ammon", it was the capital of the ancient Ammonite Kingdom. Later, during the Hellenistic period, it was renamed "Philadelphia" by the Ptolemaic ruler Philadelphus. The city then became part of the Roman and Byzantine Empires.
